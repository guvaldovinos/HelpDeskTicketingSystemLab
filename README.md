<h1>How to install a Help Desk Ticketing System (osTicket)</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/oyiivb2ygSo)

<h2>Description</h2>
The project involved setting up OS Ticket, a web-based help desk application, on a Windows 10 Pro virtual machine. The process included installing and configuring IIS (Internet Information Services) to act as a web server, setting up PHP with necessary extensions, and installing MySQL to create a dedicated database for OS Ticket. The core OS Ticket files were uploaded to the server, configured, and tested through both the end-user portal and the agent interface. Finally, basic security hardening was performed by protecting the configuration file and removing the setup folder to secure sensitive credentials and prevent unauthorized reinstallation.
